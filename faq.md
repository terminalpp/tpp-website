This page contains answers to questions most often asked about `terminalpp`. They are by no means exhaustive and may at times reflect the personal opinions of the author. 

##### Q: Why another terminal emulator? 

A: While there are many good terminal emulators (especially for Linux), very few of them actually offer reasonable support on multiple platforms at once. `terminalpp` provides the same features and the same user interface on *all* of its platforms. Furthermore, `terminalpp` already offers extra features not available in other terminals, such as [opening of remote files](/features/remote-files.html) and will support many more in the future. 

##### Q: What operating systems are supported?

A: Windows 10, Linux and macOS (10.15 and above).

##### Q: How can the terminal be installed?

A: For Windows, download the latest `msi` installer from [github releases](https://github.com/terminalpp/terminalpp/releases/latest). On Linux, `deb` and `rpm` packages are provided with releases as well, or `snap` can be used to automatically [install and update](https://snapcraft.io/terminalpp) the terminal. On macOS, download the bundle for latest release on github. 

##### Q: How do I configure the terminal?

A: Although in early stages of development, `terminalpp` offers many useful configuration options. Configuration is done either globally via the `settings.json` file, or locally for each execution via the command line. For more details see the [configuration](/features/configuration.html) section.

##### Q: How to report bugs and request features?

A: Please use the [github issues](https://github.com/terminalpp/terminalpp/issues) for both. When reporting a bug, make sure that specify the platform exhaustively (press `A-F1` in the terminal for its about box) and ideally provide a reproducible. For new features, please label the issue as a feature.
