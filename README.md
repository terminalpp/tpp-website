# `tpp` WebSite and Documentation


## Documentation

The documentation uses *Sphinx* for general documentation and *Doxygen* for source code documentation. For the purposes of this readme, it is assumed that the `tpp-website` and `tpp` itself are located side by side in a directory (i.e. doing `cd ../tpp` from the `tpp-website` will land in the root folder of the `tpp` repo).
