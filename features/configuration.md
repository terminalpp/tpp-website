Configuration of `terminalpp` is done via a JSON file in its configuration directory. Depending on the platform, this is located in:

- `%APPDATA%/terminalpp/settings.json` on Windows
- `~/.config/terminalpp/settings.json` on Linux
- `~/Library/Application Support/terminalpp/settings.json` on macOS

Keyboard shortcut `A-F10` opens the configuration file on local editor associated with JSON files. 

> The settings file is a JSON-style file enhanced with JavaScript-like comments for better readability. 

### Initial Settings

When `terminalpp` starts and the settings file is not found, or its version is not same as the application's version, the settings file (if any) is analyzed and default values are provided:

- font is selected based on the system (either a font known to be present such as `Consolas` on Windows, or system fonts are searched for good font match)
- the process to launch in the terminal is determined (WSL and bypass are preferred on Windows, Linux and macOS show default prompt of the current user)
- various folders are set, usually to temporary folder bearing `terminalpp`'s name

> Note that on Windows, if WSL is detected, `terminalpp` may attempt to install the `tpp-bypass` in it automatically. 

### Example Settings File

<!--

TODO: The configuratiom should be able to generate its own JSON schema and the following section should be generated by jekyll from that schema automatically.

-->

The following is an example of a settings file with all possible settings, their short documentation and their values. 

```json

       and to detect version changes

### Command-line arguments

The following command-line arguments can be used to override the global configuration settings for the particular execution:

- `--pty` sets the PTY used (`session.pty`)
- `--fps` sets the renderer's maximum FPS rate (`renderer.fps`)
- `--cols, -c` sets the number of columns for the terminal window (`session.cols`)
- `--rows, -r` sets the number of rows for the terminal window (`session.rows`)
- `--font` sets the default font family (`font.family`)
- `--font-size` sets the size of the font in pixels (`font.size`)
- `--log-file` sets the log file to which the input (displayed data) of the session will be stored (`session.log`) (only useful for debug purposes)
- `-e` specifies the command (`session.command`), all arguments after `-e` are considered parts of the command to execute

The arguments can be specified either using the `--arg=value`, or `--arg value` notation, i.e:

    terminalpp --cols=80 --rows=25 

or:

    terminalpp --cols 80 --rows 25
